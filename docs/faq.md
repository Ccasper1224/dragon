# Dragon FAQ

## Aren't Static CMS's dead?

Of course not! A majority of web content is static! With Dragon you can
easily build and deploy a site to a statically served CDN, such as Amazon,
and host your site for pennies if not chump change (sidebar: article on
how to do this pending, but checkout <https://github.com/srevenant/website-2-s3-cdn>.

As Dragon evolves it'll become more integrated with Phoenix, so you can
leverage the power of both a static content generator and a dynamic appserver!
